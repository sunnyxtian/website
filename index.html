        <h3>Chain Gang All Stars by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyan</h3>
        <p>
          A part sci fi, part social commentary on the prison industrial system, racism, and sports
          entertainment. Our main character is a modern day gladiator and it gets emotional.
          Though this is fiction, Nana inserts a few citations in each chapter that show how
          the book was inspired by the reality of the US prison system.

        <h3>Case Closed (Manga series) by Gosho Aoyama</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes I like to look at pictures instead of reading a bunch of words. Manga is great
          for that. Each volume has a few bite sized mysteries that the protagonist, Conan Edogawa,
          solves, even though he is only in first grade (or is he??). I'm only on volume 4
          and I'm already hooked. Great for fans of mystery novels and manga!

        <h3>Ghost Wall by Sarah Moss</h3>
        <p>
          The plot: Sulevia is a teen girl forced by her family to participate in a university
          experiment where they live like they are in Stone Age Britain. This family is basically
          boiling over with tension the entire time. Sulevia's father is controlling and
          infuriatingly misogynistic, and Sulevia starts to find her voice against him with the
          help of an older female uni student.

        <h3>Human Acts by Han Kang</h3>
        <p>
          This book was actually devastating. It is a fictionalized account of a real boy who was
          murdered during the 1980 student protests in Gwangju, Korea. If you want to
          be mad at the government and also cry, read this?

        <h3>Nichijou Volume 1 by Keiichi Arawa</h3>
        <p>
          Usually, when I start reading a new manga, I have no idea what's going on, but that
          feeling goes away after getting to know the characters, plot, etc. When I read this,
          though, I was utterly confused the whole way through, and I don't know if that's a
          good or bad thing.
